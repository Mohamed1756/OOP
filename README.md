# OOP
Object Oriented Programming 
----------------------------
it brings the use of "objects" in programming.And it follows a set of guidelines for running efficient programs.

The difference between tradition style and OOP style of programming with an example:
Traditional: student(); // we don't know the students name.
OOP: Jack.student(); // here we know who's the student is. Jack is the object here.

The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and functions that work on them, so that no other part of the code can access the data, except that function.
